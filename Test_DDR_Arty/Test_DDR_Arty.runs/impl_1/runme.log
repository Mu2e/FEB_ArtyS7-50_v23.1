	Clock Rule: rule_pll_bufhce
	Status: PASS 
	Rule Description: A PLL driving a BUFH must both be in the same horizontal row (clockregion-wise)
	TestDDR_i/TestDDR_top_0/U0/DDR_Controller/u_DDR3LController_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i (PLLE2_ADV.CLKOUT3) is locked to PLLE2_ADV_X1Y0

Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The PLL is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
